# Technical
- Move package to eu.couto.dto-utils
- Move test interfaces to dto-utils/test
- Write more extensive tests, including arrays
- Allow for pluggable naming conventions (right now it's hardcorded kebab <-> camel)
- Do a non-code-generation (i.e. non-macro) implementation

# Done
- Implement arrays
- Write a better README.md
